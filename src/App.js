				<div className="about">
					<p>Alex's Wonderland was inspired by my autistic brother-in-law, Alex, assembling a jigsaw.</p>
					<p>He absolutely loved them but quickly completed them and suffered from the same problem that a lot of jigsaws do - most the pieces were background.</p>
					<p>There are many number of jigsaws with interesting pictures, but these are often with thousands of pieces which autistic children struggle with.</p>
					<p>Each of our puzzles contains interesting details and simple lessons, such as taking care of elders and sharing.</p>
					<p>We hope that you'll join us on our journey of creating these puzzles. If you'd like to be a play-tester or have any ideas, please email me - <a href="mailto:beta@alexswonderlandpuzzles.com">beta@alexswonderlandpuzzles.com</a></p>
